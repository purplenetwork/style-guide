# Commenting

## [Inline comments](inline-comments.md)

+ For inline comments, double-slash comments (`//`) should be used.
+ Inline comments should have no indentation, starting from column 1.
+ Inline comments can span multiple lines, prefixed with the double-slash.

## [Block comments](block-comments.md)

+ Block comments should only be used to provide class and method documentation in the form of doc blocks.
+ Comments, along with docblocks, should be sparse and punchy to avoid stale documentation.
