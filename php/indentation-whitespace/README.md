# Indentation and whitespace

## [Tabs](tabs.md)

+ Use the tab character for indentation.

## [Double-indentation](double-indentation.md)

+ Avoid "double-indenting" blocks of code where no indentation is necessary for readability.

## [Line length](line-length.md)

+ Do not leave whitespace at the end of lines.
+ Be as strict as is sensible to enforce 80 character lines.
+ Limit to three levels of indentation within functions.
