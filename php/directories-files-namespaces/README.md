# Directories, files and namespaces

## [Path mapping](path-mapping.md)

+ Directories and files must either be namespace-mapped or web-mapped.
+ Namespaces must map to file paths, as per PSR-4.

## [File casing](file-casing.md)

+ Files and directories should be lowercase-hyphenated where not namespace-mapped.
+ Namespace-mapped files and directories must use `UpperCamelCase`.
+ Web mapped files and directories must use `lowercase-hyphenated-words`.
